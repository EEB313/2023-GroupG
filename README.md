# 2023-GroupG

## Goals of this project:
Our goal for this project was to understand how different factors can contribute to the spread of emerald ash borers in Ontario, including variables that can be affected by people, such as population density, and variables that are outside of our immediate control, such as time and annual temperatures.  

## Contents of repo:
Our repository contains excel files for the EAB surveillance data ("emerald-ash-borer-surveillance-data-2002-to-2020-en.xlsx"), as well as the average annual temperatures for each of the Ontario communities ("EEB313_EAB_weather_1.xlsx"). We have our main R Notebook file ("EEB313 Project.Rmd") which contains all of the code we've written to create this project. Our original proposal, mid-project-update, and several copies of our presentation slides are also stored there, together with a Word document with coding notes and some tester .Rmd files. We added a separate pdf file of our tables and figures as well.  

## Distribution of Work:
Eva and Santhija worked on the census data to add to the excel column.  
Jem and Jess worked on the temperature data to add to the excel column.  
Jem: sourced the original EAB dataset, researched EAB biology and life cycles, weather data methods & analysis, plotted all the results, results section, editing, r scripts  
Jessica: led/developed research questions/hypothesis, jot notes on how we planned to use data, created the slides for the presentation, weather data, literature review for background/introduction of paper, Introduction section, methods section, editing, r scripts  
Eva: primary analysis of EAB data and 2021 census dataset on r, wrote jot notes into paragraphs, editing, methods and results, r scripts, editing, figures for final report  
Santhija: Conclusion & implications of our study, literature review for background/predictions,justifications, assisted with developing population density analysis dataset, editing slides
